# Weather Dashboard

## Project Explained
The purpose of this project is to create a weather dashboard for current and future conditions based on city. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities.
